## 👋 Hello there!

I'm **Vladimir Somers** from Belgium 🇧🇪 — a Deep Learning & Computer Vision researcher passionate about AI for sports 🎯  
Currently at **Sportradar**, where we build intelligent systems to analyze sports videos in real time 🏟️

I believe open-source is essential for reproducible and impactful research — it helps others validate, learn from, and build upon your work. 💡

### 🧠 My path so far

Previously at **Taktik** as an R&D Software Engineer, I completed a joint **PhD (EPFL × UCLouvain × Sportradar)** focused on multi-object tracking and person re-identification, and now continue as a researcher at Sportradar.
